# AC_2Term_BitGames
Group project created during the 2 term of the Computer Programming Program in Algonquin College. 

 In this project the group has to create a fully functional e-commerce website and the choice of the group was a retro video-game store.
 The project was done in collaboration with <ADD THIS LATER> using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
  The intention was learning these techs.
